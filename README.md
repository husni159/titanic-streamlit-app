Titanic ML app
# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Web App

This is a beginner-friendly **Machine Learning** project built with **Streamlit** that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Use historical passenger data (such as age, gender, class) to train a model that predicts survival probability on the Titanic.

## 🌐 Live Demo

🛠️ Features
Predicts Titanic passenger survival using Random Forest

Clean and simple Streamlit interface

User input: Age, Gender, Ticket class, Fare, etc.

Displays predicted outcome instantly

✨ Future Improvements
Add model interpretability (SHAP or feature importance)

Try different ML algorithms (XGBoost, SVM)

Add more data preprocessing and feature engineering
